# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**
1. Completed my python homework for next week tonight after class

**Thoughts**
+ I doubt class will continue to be this easy.
+ I have to get more consistent, I am blaming the preparation for the new job and for school starting today.

### Day 4: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**
1. Did some web prototyping for CollectThisList in Adobe XD

**Thoughts**
+ It's not too hard to keep at this once I get started, I just need to get more consistent

---

### Day 3: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**
1. Completed the first portion of a Stack Skills Phyton tutorial in preparation for my class starting next week

**Thoughts**
+ Keeping up with this is harder than I first expected but I will stick with it.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018
**Today's ToDo's**:

+ Get Authentication working for [Collect this list](https://github.com/SGTMcClain/collectThisList)
+ Draw a use diagram for basic website usage
+ Switch from Materialize CSS to Bootstrap

**Today's Progress**
1. I don't know if this counts but I have learned a bit more about markdown, which should make this journey a bit easier.
2. Reading Chapter 1 in Introduction programming using phython. Today was a bit off due to a family issue, hopefully tomorrow will be better. s/n ipads suck for editing Github.

**Thoughts**
+ Decided to keep this log in reverse cronological order, which will be easier to keep up with but unfortunately harder to follow unless you read from the bottom up.  However since this is the manner in which most blogs operate I figure I will work the same way.

+ Gave some thought to the rules that I will hold myself to.  I find hours not to be a great metric on it's own to see if I was productive so I think I need add some qualifying events to the way I track my 100 days of code. So to qualify as a successful day of coding I must:

  1. Code for a minimum of 1 hour (and commit to github) or,
  2. Work on design documentation along with coding for a minimum of 1 hour (and commit to github) or,
  3. Watch an hours worth of coding tutorials or,
  4. Read articles about coding subjects and write a summary blog post on Medium summarizing what I learned

  + When completed a record of the activity should be linked in this log as a record of my activities.
+ I hope I am not holding myself to an unreasonable standard

**Today's Progress**

+ Coded for an hour but made little progress with switching from materialize to bootstrap

**Thoughts**

+ I don't know if it is worth it to switch from materialize since I seem to be spending more time trying to figure out how to switch it than actually designing and using my app.  However, it sucks that the materialize checkboxes are not working as expected, and the documentation has been less than helpful.
